** Description: Program 2 CS 344
**
** wilsjame.buildrooms.c generates 7 different room files, one room
** per file, in a directory called "wilsjame.rooms.<PROCESS ID>". 
** Out of the 10 names hard coded in this program, 7 will be chosen
** randomly as the names of the different rooms. 
** 
** Each room will randomly have 3-6 outgoing connections and a room
** type. The connections are both ways, ex) A connects to B, then B
** connects to A. The room types are: START_ROOM, END_ROOM, and
** MID_ROOM. Naturally, there is only one START and END room.
